Quality control datasets
##Introduction
* These bash scripts were used to compare [Livneh][1] dataset against other datasets, including [Maurer's][2], [CRU][3], [PRISM][4] and [SWM][5].
* Datasets were stored in the format of [NetCDF][6], which is quite efficient for storing meteorological dataset.
* [NCO][7] and [CDO][8] were used to manipulate NetCDF datasets.
